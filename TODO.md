# Requirements

## Outlook 1.5.2

* Remove "New Tab" integration since it could be really annoying for some users
* Create a Browser Action (icon in the toolbar) to open the search and option page
* Having a shortcut opening the search page (with focus inside the search field) could be really helpful
* Add Omnibar support
